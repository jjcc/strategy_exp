## 2025-10-15 evaluated the effectiveness of strategy used in last Dec to capture the gap of dividend. 
 * calculate_triple.py -- evaluate Sell/Buyback/Pay lieu strategy
 * calculate_triple_nonym.py -- the same evaluation but on None YieldMax stocks/etfs
 * Conclusion: For YM , even with lieu payment the gaps are often larger than the lieu. That resulted in profit. Not valid for Non YM
 * The opportunitiy disappear because in early Oct YieldMax changed the distribution schedule to weekly. The gap is not significant to explore
